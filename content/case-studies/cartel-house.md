# Cartel House Case Study
Had a shit API, payment and cart systems were a nightmare... UI was great, super reusable.... 

After the success the original app that was a simple proof of concept where users could order beverages, food and book meeting rooms Cartel House decided to take it to the next level by automating almost every part of the coworking space.

The use case was simple enough, allow a user to download the app walk in and access everything cartel house has to offer via the app including renting an office space.

ï¿¼# Challenges

One of the bigger challenges was the UI as this App had a lot of different UI elements and flows with many more planned in future, the UI elements and navigation would have to built in a way to account for this.

After mapping out the possible app journeys and breaking down the UI elements I started with a storybook borrowing from what I had learnt from atomic design I managed to create a minimal component library with the help of storybook and then created the base navigation due to the various flows and that a screen could be accessed in many different ways depending on the users needs.

In the end the project was one of the most scalable UI and navigation friendly application I had built.
