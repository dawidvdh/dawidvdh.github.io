I hated programming... Honestly hated it, I was an artist on various mediums (not a particularly good one).

Before programming ruined my life I worked on 3D modeling and rendering, I did illustration and animation. The only problem was that none of it was satisfying... So one day I got a phone call from a little agency in a small town where I used to live and started there as a web developer with -2% experience in agencies firstly and in web development.

Two years later I find myself infatuated with programming, it's just so abusive that it can never be boring (masochist at heart I guess), so after nothing but work for a good 4 years and by nothing but work I mean your alarm to wake up goes off just as you get home so you just shower and head back to the office... if you left the office at all, call it my university if you will. After all that I became efficient and now consider myself a relatively good Software Engineer.

But thats enough for now as I could revel in my own vanity for many more paragraphs.
